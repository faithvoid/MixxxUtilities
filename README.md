# MixxxUtilities
Various python scripts for simplifying one's workflow in Mixxx.

## m3ustrip.py - M3U Folder Information Stripper
Python script that removes all folder information from exported .m3u files in Mixxx. Useful for carrying your sets (including hotcues, BPM, etc) on a USB if you combine it with the "Write Serato Metadata" function in Mixxx.

Also has a .sh variant for Linux and macOS for those who don't want to install Python (sorry Windows users!).
