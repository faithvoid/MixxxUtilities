Various python scripts for simplifying one's workflow in Mixxx.

## m3ustrip - M3U/M3U8 Folder Information Stripper
Python and shell scripts that removes all folder information from Mixxx-exported .m3u files in the current directory. Useful for carrying your sets (including hotcues, BPM, etc) on a USB if you combine it with the "Write Serato Metadata" function in Mixxx. Shell script works in Linux, unsure about macOS, Windows users are left with the Python script to try.
