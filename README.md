# MixxxUtilities
Various python scripts for simplifying one's workflow in Mixxx. 

## m3ustrip - M3U/M3U8 Folder Information Stripper (for portable playlists)
Python and bash shell scripts that removes all folder information from Mixxx-exported .m3u/.m3u8 files in the current directory. Useful for carrying your sets (including hotcues, BPM, etc) on a USB if you combine it with the "Write Serato Metadata" function in Mixxx, as importing them without folder data will have the playlist default to the same folder the playlist file is in. Shell script works in Linux, unsure about macOS but probably, Windows users are left with the Python script to try for themselves.
